# pyZomboid

A python api for reading (and executing) lua files from TheIndieStone's Project Zomboid.

pyZomboid uses the python module lupa to execute lua, giving full access to PZ's lua tables
and functions. PZ's java component is emulated in python and additional lua.

The goal is not to have a PZ simulator, but the ability to load, test and debug various lua
components and mods from custom test scripts, or a shell interface.

*please note this emulation is a total WIP and very incomplete*
